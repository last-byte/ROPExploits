# ROPExploits - ROP Emporium challenges solved using Pwntools with ASLR turned on

## Introduction
This repository contains the challenges from ROP Emporium along with an **exploit.py** script to solve them. All of the code has been commented in order for the reader to understand what's happening. All the challenges have been completed, both 32bit and 64bit, except for *pivot* and *badchars* (still WIP at the moment). The script is able to bypass ASLR if it's turned on. 

## Requirements
* Python 2
* Pwntools

##Usage
```
git clone https://github.com/last-byte/ROPExploits.git
cd ./ROPExploits/<challenge>/(32bit|64bit)/
socat TCP4-LISTEN:1234,reuseaddr,fork EXEC:./$CHALLENGE
python exploit.py
```

##Warnings
* Make sure the libc used by exploit is the same your binary is using (`ldd ./binary` and check it) 
* While syntax is compatible with Python 3 use Python 2 instead because Pwntools is quite problematic with Python 3

##TO-DO
* [ ] Solve pivot
* [ ] Solve badchars
